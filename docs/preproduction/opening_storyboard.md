# Opening Cinematic Storyboard – "Audit Alarm"

| Panel | Camera & Framing | Action Beat | FX & UI Notes | Caption / Dialogue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Slow push-in** on dim tunnel, Dutch angle to suggest imbalance. | Vic peers through cracked locker door, stage lights flicker. | Flickering neon sign “Charity Match – Sponsored by Transparency LLC.” Ambient crowd cheer fading. | Narrator (VO): “Tonight’s charity match raised eyebrows—and offshore interest rates.” |
| 2 | **Medium close-up** with handheld wobble. | Vic snaps briefcase shut; bundles stamped “Infrastructure Grant” pop out. | Cartoon cash burst; overlay prompt: **Tap to stash**. | Vic: “Note to self: invest in better rubber bands.” |
| 3 | **Insert shot** of champagne cork ricocheting toward massive red button. | Cork slams “AUDIT” alarm; sprinkler rains confetti-shaped subpoenas. | Alarm SFX crossfades into rhythmic beat matching soundtrack. | PA: “Emergency! Transparency protocols breached!” |
| 4 | **Hero shot** from low angle. | Agent Hilda descends on retractable podium flanked by drones projecting searchlights. | Drones trail blue-and-gold strobe reminiscent of EU flag. | Hilda: “Operation Photo-Op is a go. Remember, smiles wide for the press!” |
| 5 | **Whip pan** tracking left. | Vic vaults over donation boxes, lands on scooter labeled “Infrastructure Pilot.” | Motion lines emphasize speed; UI flashes **Swipe Up to Jump**. | Narrator: “Public spending meets private getaway.” |
| 6 | **Side-scrolling mockup** (2.5D). | Garage door slams; Vic slides under, sparks shower from metal grate. | Parallax layers preview city chase environment. | Béla (VO): “Mind the tuxedo queue, sir!” |
| 7 | **Wide aerial** establishing rooftop path. | Vic launches via fireworks that spell “Re-Election Tour.” Protest crowd spills into street below. | Fireworks timed to beat drop; HUD heat meter flickers to life. | Crowd Chant SFX: “Hey hey! Ho ho! Where’d the stadium budget go?” |
| 8 | **Freeze-frame** with anamorphic squeeze. | UI overlay displays three alibi choices with caricature icons. | Tooltip describing first-run bonus. | Vic: “Can’t spell ‘plausible’ without ‘possible’!” |
| 9 | **Match cut** to gameplay camera. | Player confirms choice; jetpack sputters to life with receipts as exhaust. | Transition from 24fps cinematic to 60fps gameplay; UI fades in (score, heat meter). | Narrator: “Strap in for tonight’s fiscal fireworks.” |
| 10 | **Dynamic tracking shot** replicating gameplay FOV. | Agents burst through skylight in background, establishing ongoing chase. | Tutorial prompts animate at screen edges (Swipe, Tap). | Hilda (VO): “Team, let’s keep the optics on-brand!” |

## Cinematic Rhythm & Timing Notes
- **Duration:** ~45 seconds before control handoff.
- **Music:** Balkan-electro track ramps from sly bass groove (panels 1–3) to brassy chase anthem (panels 7–10).
- **Color Script:** Start with warm interior oranges, shift to cool night-time blues accented with magenta protest signage.
- **Transition Strategy:** Final panel uses motion blur and UI elements from gameplay to ensure seamless shift into interactive tutorial.

## Production Checklist
1. **Storyboard Line Art:** Greyscale thumbnails with highlighted props (briefcase, alarm button, drones).
2. **Animatic:** Rough timing pass matching BPM 110 → 128 to test comedic beats.
3. **VO Scratch Track:** Record temporary lines for Vic, Hilda, Narrator to validate timing before final casting.
4. **Integration:** Export storyboard panels into Godot cutscene timeline using AnimationPlayer with signal trigger for gameplay start.
