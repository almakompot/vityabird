# "Endless Escape" Satirical Script Draft

## Tone Pillars
- **Playfully Subversive:** Every line lands as a wink to the camera—outlandish metaphors and exaggerated bureaucracy keep things comedic rather than accusatory.
- **Cartoon-Calamity Pacing:** Dialogue punctuates slapstick mishaps; no quip lasts long enough to slow the chase.
- **Lovable Rogues Gallery:** Orbán’s analog and the task-force both relish the absurdity, ensuring satire skewers power structures while letting characters stay charming.

## Cast of Exaggerated Figures
| Name | Role | Hook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Viktor “Vic” Orbital** | Player avatar; charismatic schemer | Balancing a briefcase overflowing with “consultancy vouchers.” |
| **Agent Hilda Hex** | Lead Interpol chaser | Calm, deadpan, wields a megaphone that fires subpoenas like confetti. |
| **Junior Agent Béla** | Tutorial VO; overeager rookie | Constantly fact-checking with a tablet that glitches with pop-up ads. |
| **Narrator** | Satirical VO | Breaks the fourth wall to recap alleged scandals as tabloid headlines. |
| **Protest Chorus** | Crowd SFX | Chant in melodic call-and-response (“Hey hey! Ho ho! Where’d the stadium budget go?”). |
